# Report-Privacy-Safety-and-Security
In todayâ€™s world, we are more and more affected by changes in technology, which
often leads to a new way of interacting with the world and people around us. The
effects of these innovations are in most cases beneficial to us and our society, whether
it is the emergence of vehicles that allow us to travel great distances in a short time,
or the age of the Internet that has revolutionized the way we share information and
communicate with each other. However, progress always has side effects, some of
which unfortunately bring new problems that we have to deal with. One such issue
is security, privacy, and the safety of our activities in online spaces. This report will
look at the broad spectrum of this problem and provide some examples of security
risks that the average citizen may face, as well as some solutions, mainly in the
form of some already known algorithms. The report will also highlight some new
problems that may arise in the online space.
